P2 Sorting Analysis

Key pointed noticed in this sorting analysis is that bubble is very inefficent 
with sorting. After bubble is insertion sorting and then the most efficent is 
selection sorting. While insertion and bubble had to make tons and tons of moves 
selection had a max 3 times the total size of the vector being sorted. It also
was able to save a large amount of time when sorting compared to the others its 
impressive how much time it actually saves. If n being amount of numbers it 
took n - 1 for the loop to complete the actually sorting.

Looking at shell sorting, its evident is that it is quick but not as fast as selection
but faster than the other two. Looking at it also shows that in mirco-seconds it is 
much quicker too.
